GCW Zero Image Generation Tools
======

The installation uses three images:
* boot image: boot sector, boot loader
* kernel image: kernel partition (vfat), containing Linux kernels
* data image: data partition (ext4), containing rootfs and preloaded apps

This repository contains the tools to create all three images.
